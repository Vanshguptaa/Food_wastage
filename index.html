                            Fruit waste is a major contributor to global food waste, with a significant amount being
                            discarded due to overproduction, spoilage, or cosmetic imperfections. This waste has
                            economic, social, and environmental impacts, as it wastes valuable resources and contributes
                            to greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing fruit waste can be achieved by buying only what is
                            needed, using fruit before it spoils, and donating excess fruit to food banks or composting
                            it. By reducing fruit waste, we can conserve resources, alleviate hunger, and mitigate the
                            environmental impacts of food waste.</h4>

                            and waste valuable resources. Reducing vegetable waste can be achieved through practices
                            such as meal planning, using vegetable scraps for stock or broth, and composting. By
                            reducing vegetable waste, we can help create a more sustainable and efficient food system.

                            Overproduction food waste has significant economic and environmental impacts, wasting
                            resources and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing overproduction food waste
                            can be achieved through better planning and forecasting, improving supply chain efficiency,
                            and donating excess food to food banks or other organizations.

                            food waste has increased in recent years, causing environmental, social, and economic
                            concerns. Every day, households produce a large amount of kitchen waste, including food
                            scraps, spoiled food, and cooking oils. Most of this waste ends up in landfills, where it
                            decomposes and produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.
                            Therefore, it is crucial to manage kitchen waste effectively and reduce the amount that ends

                        <h4 class="para3">One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of
                            appropriate planning on the consumer part. Sometimes people buy lots of food without
                            appropriately making plans on when and how the food will be prepared for consumption.
                            Coupled with the contemporary schedules of work and appointments, people, therefore, tend to
                            change food preparation plans or fail to remember using it on time.
                            At times it's out of most people's control which leads to the expiry of the foods after
                            which they are thrown as waste. Also due to lack of appropriate planning, people find
                            themselves having badly prepared food that just doesn't taste great. It all ends up as

                        <h4 class="para3">Most of the time, food is also wasted because of purchasing or preparing too
                            much. If one purchases or prepares too much food than is needed, then it's obvious the
                            excess food on the plate will go to waste. In such scenarios, leftovers and partially used
                            food account for the food that goes to waste.
                            Alternatively, the partially used food is at times put at the back of the fridge and is
                            never reused. The same applies to excess purchases that end up passing their expiration
                            dates and therefore looks, tastes, and smells bad. At the end of it all, all the excess ends
                            up as waste food.

                        <h4 class="para3">Most restaurants, hotels, and the foodservice industry alike have a tendency
                            of over-preparing/producing food. While the intention is good especially in anticipation of
                            high customer volume and the ability to not running out of the menu, over-preparation often
                            leads to wastage if all the food is unsold. DC Central Kitchen committed to the course of
                            reducing food wastage, points out that overproduction in the foodservice industry is the
                            leading cause of food wastage.
                            Since the food service operations lack the ability to quantify the amount of food consumed
                            on average, the kitchens keep producing amounts thought to be enough but most of it is
                            actually not needed.
                            Besides, some managers believe producing food in large batches minimizes costs, but in
                            actual fact, it results in more waste as compared to cook-to-order preparation or cooking in
                            small batches.

                            markets, and supermarkets often result in food wastage. Foodservice operations are
                            habitually more focused on over-merchandizing in food stores and supermarkets by using
                            beautiful and attractive displays thereby creating the idea of abundance in an attempt to
                            promote sales and customer satisfaction.

                            The overlooked aspect of over-merchandizing is its association with increased food waste.
                            When people buy more than needed, the excess will often end up in the trash bin.
                            Over-ordering also leads to the expiry of food staff with a limited shelf life as some of it

                    maximize agricultural
                    yields, farmers have increasingly invaded wild areas in search of more fertile lands which has led

                    birds, fish, mammals, and amphibians.
                    Agricultural practices such as mono-cropping have also compounded biodiversity loss. The mass

                    packed fridge may look appealing, but it may lead to food waste if the household cannot eat all of
                    the food.</li>

                    necessary to throw out foods that are slightly past their prime.
                    For instance, many greens and vegetables may slightly soften or wilt when they are just past ripe.
                    They still may make excellent additions to soups, smoothies, or baked dishes</li>

                    of waste. Taking an inventory of the food in the house and making a grocery list before going to the
                    store
                    might help people avoid purchasing unnecessary foods and cut back on potential waste.

                    at
                    home and help them to identify foods that are ready to eat.
                    “FIFO” stands for “first in, first out” and is a useful way to organize food at home. Many
                    restaurants and grocery stores use this system to reduce waste, too.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 5) Perishable items, such as fruits and vegetables, each have their best way to
                    store
                    to avoid spoilage.
                    Some tips include:
                    keeping the refrigerator below 5°C (41°F),
                    storing cooked foods on shelves above raw foods,
                    storing food in sealed containers</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 6) Making a meal menu for the week may help some people organize their food usage
                    and
                    cut back on waste.
                    Using online tools or cookbooks to help plan out meals for the week can a person to compile an
                    accurate shopping list.
                    It may take a few weeks for each household to get the menu right, but having a set weekly menu might
                    help some people reduce the guesswork around meals and avoid wasting food.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 7) When eating out, a person can avoid food waste by asking for a meal that does
                    not
                    contain ingredients they do not enjoy.
                    For instance, if brunch at a restaurant comes with a side of toast that a person would not usually
                    eat, merely asking them to leave off the toast can help prevent waste.
                    In addition to reducing waste, smaller portions can also help prevent a person from overeating.</li>

                    opting to
                    avoid the food tray may help prevent waste.
                    A 2012 study found that not using a food tray reduced food waste by 32% in a university dining hall.
